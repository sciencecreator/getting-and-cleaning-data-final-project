## Dataset
This dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

## Variables
- `Subject`: Identifier for the subject.
- `Activity`: Activity performed (e.g., WALKING, SITTING).
- Other variables: Mean and standard deviation measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

## Transformations
1. Merged training and test datasets.
2. Extracted mean and standard deviation measurements.
3. Named activities with descriptive labels.
4. Created a tidy dataset with averages grouped by subject and activity.
